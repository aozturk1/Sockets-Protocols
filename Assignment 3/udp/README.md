## Description
A program that is a simple UDP connection client server based quote guessing game with minimal simple GUI and a JSON custom protocol design. Server will ask and send user name as well as sending a picture. 

## Check-List
### 2 Preliminary Things
- [X] 1 Structure (two programs one TCP one UDP(insteadData putJSONtoString jsonStringtoBytes), separate folder called tcp and udp)
- [X] 2 Gradle file (for each project)
- [X] 3 Run (gradle runServer - Pport = port and gradle runClient - Pport = port -Phost = hostIP)
- [X] 4 Also run (gradle runServer and gradle runClient shown in a 5 min screen capture showing both and their features)
- [X] 5 A README.md (for each project)
    - [X] a) Description
    - [X] b) Checklist
    - [X] c) Explanation of how to run
    - [X] d) UML Diagram
    - [X] e) Protocol
    - [ ] f) Explain how your code is robust

### 3.2 UDP The Game
- [ ] 1 Asking and sending of the user's name
- [ ] 2 Send image from server to client
- [ ] 3 Explain how protocol changed for UDP
